## Introduction
This is a project built by QYuQianchen at ETHLisbon 2021 hackathon. 

For more details, please find the submission at [DevPost](https://devpost.com/software/integraldao-protocol)

## Structure

This folder contains source code written during the hackathon:
1. `smart-contracts`: On-chain governance protocol built with [Tally](https://www.withtally.com/) and [OpenZepplin](https://openzeppelin.com/).
2. `subgraph`: Off-chain governance package (demo) built with [TheGraph](https://thegraph.com/).

## Acknowlegement 
Although the coding part was done solo by myself, I want to thank everyone who had listened to my ideas during the hackathon. Your feedback makes the project happen. ðŸ§¡
